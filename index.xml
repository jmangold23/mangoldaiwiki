      <description>In this comprehensive guide, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive deep into setting up Azure Machine Learning&amp;rsquo;s Automated ML for time-series forecasting. Unlike classical time series methods, Automated ML takes a unique approach by &amp;ldquo;pivoting&amp;rdquo; past time-series values to become additional dimensions for the regressor, along with other predictors. This approach allows Automated ML to incorporate multiple contextual variables and their relationships during training, making it a powerful tool for real-world forecasting scenarios.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start by preparing your data for time-series modeling, ensuring that all features used in training can be used when running predictions for your intended horizon.</description>
