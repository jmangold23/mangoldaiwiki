<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Azure Cost Optimization workbook serves as a centralized hub for some of the most commonly used cost optimization tools and insights. It offers a range of recommendations and insights aligned with the Well-Architected Framework&rsquo;s Cost Optimization pillar, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure Advisor cost recommendations</li>
<li>Identification of idle resources</li>
<li>Management of improperly deallocated Virtual Machines</li>
<li>Recommendations for applying Azure Reservations and Savings Plan for Compute</li>
<li>Insights into using Azure Hybrid Benefit options</li>
</ul>
<p>The workbook is organized into different tabs and subtabs, each focusing on a specific area to help you reduce the cost of your Azure environment. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>: Provides a high-level summary of your Azure resource distribution, security and reliability recommendations.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Optimization</strong>: Focuses on potential savings related to the rate optimization of your Azure services, including Azure Hybrid Benefit, Azure Reservations, and Azure Savings Plan for Compute.</li>
<li><strong>Usage Optimization</strong>: Examines potential savings related to the usage optimization of your Azure services, such as Compute, Storage, and Networking resources.</li>
<li><strong>Top 10 Services</strong>: Offers insights and recommendations for optimizing the costs of other popular Azure services, including Web Apps, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Synapse, and Azure Monitor.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each tab supports filtering, exporting, and quick-fix capabilities, allowing you to focus on specific workloads, share insights with your team, and streamline the optimization process.</p>
