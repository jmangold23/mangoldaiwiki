      <p>Azure is a robust cloud platform that offers a comprehensive suite of security services to help businesses safeguard their cloud resources, detect threats, and respond effectively. In this in-depth article, we&rsquo;ll explore the various security capabilities available in Azure and how you can leverage them to create a secure, end-to-end cloud environment.</p>
<h2 id="secure-and-protect">Secure and Protect</h2>
<p>One of the key advantages of using Azure is the wide array of security tools and capabilities it provides. These services help you implement a layered, defense-in-depth strategy across identity, hosts, networks, and data. Some of the most notable services in this category include:</p>

<p><strong>General</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft Sentinel</strong>: A scalable, cloud-native SIEM and SOAR solution that provides intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise.</li>
<li><strong>Azure Monitor logs and metrics</strong>: A comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments.</li>
</ul>
