      <p>Migrating from Slack to Microsoft Teams can be a complex and daunting task, but with the right plan and strategy, it can be a smooth and successful transition. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the entire process, from assessing your Slack workspaces to rolling out Teams in your organization.</p>
<h2 id="plan-your-migration-from-slack">Plan Your Migration from Slack</h2>
<h3 id="understand-your-slack-service-plan">Understand Your Slack Service Plan</h3>
<p>Your Slack service plan will determine what you can and can&rsquo;t migrate. Some plans only allow you to export public channels and files, while others may require additional steps to include private channels and direct messages. Determine your Slack Workspace service level by logging into Slack and checking the &ldquo;About this Workspace&rdquo; page.</p>
<h3 id="assess-your-slack-workspaces">Assess Your Slack Workspaces</h3>
<p>Before you can plan your migration, you need to gather information about your Slack workspaces. Understand how they are being used, how many workspaces are being moved, and which ones you want to migrate (and which ones you want to leave behind). If you&rsquo;re a member of the Slack Workspaces, you can analyze the usage yourself by going to <code>&lt;your Slack workspace&gt;.slack.com/stats</code>.</p>
<h3 id="determine-what-to-export">Determine What to Export</h3>
<p>In Slack, users join channels that are part of a Workspace, whereas in Teams, users join a team that is a collection of channels. Examine your Slack analytics to determine which channels are most active and should be migrated. Decide how you want to group your Slack channels into Teams and who should be members of each team.</p>
<h3 id="manage-user-identities">Manage User Identities</h3>
<p>The identity schemes you used in Slack may not map directly to Microsoft 365 or Office 365. Create a user-ID map before planning your Teams rollout to ensure a smooth transition.</p>
<h2 id="plan-your-teams-deployment">Plan Your Teams Deployment</h2>
<h3 id="determine-your-team-and-channel-structure">Determine Your Team and Channel Structure</h3>
<p>Understand the scope of your Slack Workspaces and how they map to Teams. You may have a single Slack Workspace that maps to a single Team, or you may have multiple Workspaces that map to multiple Teams. Use your Slack analytics data to create logical team and channel groupings.</p>
<h3 id="retain-channel-history-and-files">Retain Channel History and Files</h3>
<p>Depending on your organization&rsquo;s requirements, you may need to retain the history and files from your Slack channels. There are both free and paid solutions available, including GitHub projects like ChannelSurf and Slack Export Viewer, that can help with this process.</p>
<h3 id="migrate-apps-and-custom-integrations">Migrate Apps and Custom Integrations</h3>
<p>Review the list of Slack apps and custom integrations used in your organization and determine which ones you want to move to Teams. Check the Teams Marketplace to see if the apps are available, and consider using Microsoft 365 Connectors to achieve similar functionality.</p>
<h3 id="prepare-users-for-the-transition">Prepare Users for the Transition</h3>
<p>The success of your Teams deployment hinges on how well your users are prepared for the change. Provide comprehensive training and resources to help them understand the differences between Slack and Teams, and ensure a smooth transition.</p>
<h2 id="roll-out-teams">Roll Out Teams</h2>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve planned your migration, it&rsquo;s time to begin creating your Teams and channels. Once you&rsquo;ve set up the structure, start copying files from Slack channels into Teams and configuring your apps. Gradually onboard users, ensuring they have the necessary permissions and access to the appropriate teams and channels.</p>
<p>Remember to remove Slack access at an agreed-upon date to avoid the need for re-exporting and importing changes. Follow the steps outlined in the <a href="./deploy-overview.md">How to roll out Teams</a> guide to ensure a successful deployment.</p>
<p>Migrating from Slack to Microsoft Teams can be a complex process, but with the right plan and strategy, you can ensure a seamless transition for your organization. By following the guidance provided in this comprehensive guide, you can set your teams up for success in the new Microsoft Teams environment.</p>
