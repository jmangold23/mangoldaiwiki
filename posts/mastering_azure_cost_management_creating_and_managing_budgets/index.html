<p>Budgets in Azure Cost Management are a powerful tool to help you plan, monitor, and control your cloud spending. By creating and managing budgets, you can proactively inform your organization about spending, manage costs, and track how spending evolves over time.</p>
<p>In this comprehensive guide, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the process of creating and managing budgets in the Azure portal, as well as exploring programmatic options using PowerShell, CLI, and Terraform.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-budgets-in-azure-cost-management">Understanding Budgets in Azure Cost Management</h2>
<p>Budgets in Azure Cost Management serve several key purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Planning and Accountability</strong>: Budgets help you plan for and drive organizational accountability around cloud spending. They enable you to set spending limits and monitor progress against those limits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost Monitoring and Alerting</strong>: You can configure alerts based on actual or forecasted costs to ensure your spending stays within your organizational limits. Notifications are triggered when budget thresholds are exceeded, allowing you to take timely action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost Analysis and Tracking</strong>: Budgets provide a way to compare and track your spending as you analyze costs, giving you visibility into how your cloud usage and expenditure evolve over time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Azure Cost Management integrates budget data with your overall cost and usage information, providing a comprehensive view of your cloud investments.</p>
<h2 id="creating-budgets-in-the-azure-portal">Creating Budgets in the Azure Portal</h2>
<p>One of the easiest ways to create and manage budgets is through the Azure portal. Let&rsquo;s walk through the process step-by-step:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com">Azure portal</a> and navigate to the <strong>Budgets</strong> service under <strong>Cost Management + Billing</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to create a new budget.</li>
<li>Ensure the correct scope is selected, such as a subscription or resource group. You can also apply filters to focus the budget on specific costs.</li>
<li>Provide a name for the budget and choose a reset period (monthly, quarterly, or annual).</li>
<li>Set the budget amount based on your forecasted or desired spending, and configure alerting thresholds for both actual and forecasted costs.</li>
<li>Review the budget details and complete the creation process.</li>
</ol>
<p>After creating a budget, you can view its performance in the <strong>Cost Analysis</strong> feature, where you can compare your actual spending against the budget.</p>
<h2 id="programmatic-budget-management">Programmatic Budget Management</h2>
<p>In addition to the Azure portal, you can also create and manage budgets programmatically using various tools and frameworks. Here are a few examples:</p>
<h3 id="powershell">PowerShell</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an Enterprise Agreement (EA) customer, you can use the Azure PowerShell module to create and edit budgets. However, for the latest functionality, we recommend using the Budgets REST API, as PowerShell-based commands may not support the newest features.</p>
<h3 id="azure-cli">Azure CLI</h3>
<p>The Azure CLI provides a convenient way to create and configure budgets. You can use the <code>az consumption budget</code> commands to automate budget management tasks.</p>
<h3 id="terraform">Terraform</h3>
<p>Terraform, the popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, also supports creating and managing Azure budgets. You can define your budget resources in Terraform configuration files and apply them to your Azure environment.</p>
<p>Regardless of the approach you choose, programmatic budget management allows you to integrate budgets into your broader cost management and automation strategies, ensuring consistency and scalability.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-budget-capabilities">Advanced Budget Capabilities</h2>
<p>Azure Cost Management offers several advanced features to enhance your budget management experience:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Combining Azure and AWS Costs</strong>: You can create budgets that encompass both your Azure and AWS costs by grouping them under a shared management group.</li>
<li><strong>Budgeting for Reserved Instances and Purchases</strong>: Budget cost evaluations now include reserved instance and purchase data, providing a more complete view of your cloud expenditure.</li>
<li><strong>Integrating with Action Groups</strong>: When creating or editing a budget, you can configure it to trigger an Azure Monitor Action Group, enabling you to automate notifications and remediation actions.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile App Support</strong>: The Azure mobile app allows you to view and monitor your budgets on the go, making it easy to stay informed and responsive to your cloud spending.</li>
</ol>
<p>By leveraging these advanced features, you can gain deeper insights, automate budget-related processes, and ensure your cloud costs are actively managed and aligned with your organizational goals.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Budgets are a fundamental component of effective cost management in Azure. By creating and managing budgets, you can proactively plan, monitor, and control your cloud spending, ensuring your organization stays within its desired spending limits.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re using the Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, or Terraform, the principles and techniques covered in this guide will help you master the art of budget management in Azure Cost Management. By incorporating budgets into your overall cost optimization strategy, you can drive greater financial accountability and make informed decisions about your cloud investments.</p>
