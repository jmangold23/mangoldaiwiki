      <h1 id="seamless-migration-of-azure-cloud-services-classic-to-azure-cloud-services-extended-support">Seamless Migration of Azure Cloud Services (classic) to Azure Cloud Services (extended support)</h1>
<p>Azure Cloud Services is a widely used Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering that allows you to build, deploy, and manage scalable and highly available web applications and APIs. Recently, Microsoft introduced Azure Cloud Services (extended support), which provides several enhancements over the classic Cloud Services model.</p>
<p>This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of migrating your existing Azure Cloud Services (classic) deployments to the newer Azure Cloud Services (extended support) platform. We&rsquo;ll explore the key benefits, migration paths, and the step-by-step process to ensure a smooth and successful transition.</p>
<h2 id="key-benefits-of-azure-cloud-services-extended-support">Key Benefits of Azure Cloud Services (extended support)</h2>
<p>Azure Cloud Services (extended support) offers several advantages over the classic deployment model:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Regional Resiliency</strong>: The extended support model provides regional resiliency, ensuring your applications can withstand data center failures and offer better availability.</li>
<li><strong>Feature Parity</strong>: Cloud Services (extended support) maintains feature parity with the classic deployment model, allowing you to seamlessly migrate your existing workloads.</li>
<li><strong>Azure Resource Manager Capabilities</strong>: The extended support model integrates with Azure Resource Manager, providing access to advanced features like role-based access control (RBAC), tags, policies, and deployment templates.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing Parity</strong>: Both the classic and extended support models offer <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cloud-services/">similar pricing structures</a>, ensuring a consistent cost experience.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="migration-paths-redeploy-vs-in-place-migration">Migration Paths: Redeploy vs. In-place Migration</h2>
<p>Azure Cloud Services (extended support) supports two primary migration paths from the classic deployment model:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Redeploy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customers can deploy a new cloud service directly in Azure Resource Manager and then delete the old cloud service in Azure Service Manager after thorough validation.</li>
<li>Redeploy allows you to define resource names, organize or reuse resources as preferred, and reuse service configuration and definition files with minimal changes.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to orchestrate traffic to the new deployment and delete the old cloud services in Azure Resource Manager.</li>
<li>This approach offers more flexibility but requires additional time to migrate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In-place Migration</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The in-place migration tool enables a seamless, platform-orchestrated migration of existing Cloud Services (classic) deployments to Cloud Services (extended support).</li>
<li>For in-place migration, the platform defines resource names, organizes each deployment and related resources in individual Resource Groups, and modifies the existing configuration and definition files for Azure Resource Manager.</li>
<li>Migration retains IP addresses, and the data path remains the same. The platform also deletes the Cloud Services (classic) resources after migration.</li>
<li>This approach offers a quicker migration but with less flexibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When evaluating your migration strategy, consider your application&rsquo;s requirements and future plans. If your application is not evolving, Cloud Services (extended support) may be a viable option as it provides a quick migration path. However, if your application requires a more modern feature set, you may want to explore other Azure services like Virtual Machine Scale Sets, App Service, Azure Kubernetes Service, or Azure Service Fabric.</p>
<h2 id="migration-steps">Migration Steps</h2>
<p>The migration process for Cloud Services (classic) to Cloud Services (extended support) involves the following four key steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Validate Migration</strong>: This step checks if the migration will not be prevented by common unsupported scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare Migration</strong>: The platform duplicates the resource metadata in Azure Resource Manager, locks all resources for create/update/delete operations, and ensures the metadata is synchronized across Azure Service Manager and Azure Resource Manager.</li>
<li><strong>Abort Migration</strong>: If needed, this step removes the resource metadata from Azure Resource Manager and unlocks all resources for further operations.</li>
<li><strong>Commit Migration</strong>: This final step removes the resource metadata from Azure Service Manager, unlocks the resources, and completes the migration. After the commit operation, the abort option is no longer available.</li>
</ol>
<p>Throughout the migration process, the Prepare, Abort, and Commit operations are idempotent, meaning you can retry them if they fail, and the platform will handle the recovery.</p>
<h2 id="supported-resources-and-features">Supported Resources and Features</h2>
<p>Azure Cloud Services (extended support) migration supports a wide range of resources and features, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage Accounts</li>
<li>Virtual Networks (excluding Azure Batch)</li>
<li>Network Security Groups</li>
<li>Reserved Public IP addresses</li>
<li>Endpoint Access Control Lists</li>
<li>User Defined Routes</li>
<li>Internal load balancer</li>
<li>Certificate migration to Key Vault</li>
<li>Plugins and Extensions (XML and JSON-based)</li>
<li>On Start / On Stop Tasks</li>
<li>Deployments with Accelerated Networking</li>
<li>Deployments using single or multiple roles</li>
<li>Basic load balancer</li>
<li>Input, Instance Input, and Internal Endpoints</li>
<li>Dynamic Public IP addresses</li>
<li>DNS Name</li>
<li>Network Traffic Rules</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the migration process supports various configuration scenarios, such as virtual networks containing Microsoft Entra Domain Services, cloud services with a single deployment slot, and deployments not in a publicly visible virtual network.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Migrating your Azure Cloud Services (classic) deployments to the Azure Cloud Services (extended support) model can provide you with significant benefits, including regional resiliency, feature parity, and integration with Azure Resource Manager. By understanding the migration paths, supported resources and configurations, and the step-by-step process, you can ensure a smooth and successful transition for your cloud-hosted applications and services.</p>
