<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this comprehensive guide, you will learn how to assess and migrate a multi-tier application from an on-premises Hyper-V environment to Microsoft Azure. You will leverage Azure Migrate as the central hub for executing the migration, along with a variety of accompanying tools to ensure a successful migration.</p>
<p>After completing this guide, you will have a thorough understanding of the role of Azure Migrate and related migration tools, as well as the steps required to successfully migrate an on-premises multi-tier application to Azure.</p>
<h2 id="assessing-the-on-premises-environment">Assessing the On-Premises Environment</h2>
<p>The first step is to assess the existing on-premises environment using Azure Migrate: Server Assessment. This includes deploying the Azure Migrate appliance on the Hyper-V host to gather information about the environment, as well as installing the Microsoft Monitoring Agent and Dependency Agent on the VMs to enable deeper analysis through Azure Migrate&rsquo;s dependency visualization feature.</p>
<h3 id="deploying-the-azure-migrate-appliance">Deploying the Azure Migrate Appliance</h3>
<p>The Azure Migrate appliance is deployed on the Hyper-V host to communicate with the Hyper-V server and gather configuration and performance data about the on-premises VMs. This data is then sent back to your Azure Migrate project.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Azure portal, create a new Azure Migrate project and select the Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment and Azure Migrate: Server Migration tools.</li>
<li>In the Azure Migrate project, initiate the discovery process by deploying the Azure Migrate appliance on the Hyper-V host.</li>
<li>Configure the Azure Migrate appliance, including providing the Hyper-V host credentials for discovery.</li>
<li>Start the discovery process to begin gathering information about the on-premises VMs.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="assessing-the-application">Assessing the Application</h3>
<p>Once the discovery process is complete, you can create a migration assessment for the application using the data gathered by the Azure Migrate appliance.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Azure Migrate project, create a new assessment for the discovered VMs.</li>
<li>Review the assessment results, which provide insights into the Azure readiness of the VMs and recommendations for migration.</li>
<li>Explore the Azure Migrate dependency visualization feature, which provides a deep understanding of the application&rsquo;s dependencies.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="migrating-the-application-database">Migrating the Application Database</h2>
<p>The next step is to migrate the application&rsquo;s database from the on-premises SQL Server to Azure SQL Database. This is accomplished using the Azure Database Migration Service (DMS), which leverages the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) for assessment and schema migration.</p>
<ol>
<li>Register the Microsoft.DataMigration resource provider in the target Azure subscription.</li>
<li>Create a new Azure Database Migration Service instance.</li>
<li>Use the Data Migration Assistant to assess the on-premises database and identify any migration blocking issues.</li>
<li>Create a DMS migration project and migrate the database schema.</li>
<li>Migrate the on-premises data to the Azure SQL Database.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="migrating-the-application-and-web-tiers">Migrating the Application and Web Tiers</h2>
<p>The final step is to migrate the application and web tiers of the application from the on-premises Hyper-V environment to Azure using Azure Migrate: Server Migration.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Azure Storage Account to be used by Azure Migrate: Server Migration.</li>
<li>Create a private endpoint to allow the migrated VMs to securely access the Azure SQL Database.</li>
<li>Register the Hyper-V host with Azure Migrate: Server Migration and enable replication of the on-premises VMs to Azure.</li>
<li>Customize the migrated VM settings, including static internal IP addresses to match the on-premises configuration.</li>
<li>Perform the final migration of the VMs to Azure.</li>
<li>Configure the application tier to use the migrated Azure SQL Database.</li>
<li>Test the migrated application to ensure it is functioning as expected.</li>
<li>Perform post-migration tasks, such as installing the Azure VM Agent on the migrated VMs and cleaning up temporary migration resources.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following the steps outlined in this guide, you will be able to successfully migrate a complex, multi-tier application from an on-premises Hyper-V environment to Microsoft Azure, leveraging a variety of Azure migration tools and services.</p>
