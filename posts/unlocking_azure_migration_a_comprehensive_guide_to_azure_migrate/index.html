      <p>Azure Migrate is a powerful service that simplifies the process of migrating, modernizing, and optimizing your infrastructure in the cloud. Whether you&rsquo;re looking to move your servers, databases, web apps, or virtual desktops to Azure, Azure Migrate provides a unified platform to streamline every step of your cloud journey.</p>
<h2 id="a-simplified-migration-journey">A Simplified Migration Journey</h2>
<p>Azure Migrate offers a range of tools to help you assess, migrate, and modernize your on-premises resources. The service provides a single portal to start, run, and track your migration to Azure, ensuring a seamless and efficient experience.</p>
<h3 id="comprehensive-assessment-and-migration-tools">Comprehensive Assessment and Migration Tools</h3>
<p>The Azure Migrate hub includes tools like Azure Migrate: Discovery and Assessment and Migration and Modernization, which enable you to discover and assess your on-premises servers, SQL Server instances, web apps, and more, and then migrate them to Azure. Additionally, Azure Migrate integrates with a variety of third-party tools, expanding the scope of supported use cases.</p>
<h3 id="migrate-servers-databases-and-web-apps">Migrate Servers, Databases, and Web Apps</h3>
<p>With Azure Migrate, you can assess and migrate a wide range of on-premises resources to Azure, including servers (both virtual and physical), databases (SQL Server instances and databases), and web applications. The service also supports the migration of virtual desktops and offline data using Azure Data Box products.</p>
<h3 id="leverage-integrated-tools-and-isv-integrations">Leverage Integrated Tools and ISV Integrations</h3>
<p>Azure Migrate seamlessly integrates with various Azure tools and services, such as the Data Migration Assistant, Azure Database Migration Service, and Web App Migration Assistant, making the migration process more streamlined and efficient. Additionally, the service integrates with several independent software vendor (ISV) offerings, providing even greater flexibility and capabilities.</p>
<h3 id="discover-assess-and-migrate-with-confidence">Discover, Assess, and Migrate with Confidence</h3>
<p>The Azure Migrate: Discovery and Assessment tool helps you understand the Azure readiness, sizing, and cost estimation for your on-premises servers, SQL Servers, and web apps. The tool uses a lightweight Azure Migrate appliance to discover and assess your environment, without the need for agents on your servers.</p>
<h3 id="modernize-and-optimize-with-azure-migrate">Modernize and Optimize with Azure Migrate</h3>
<p>Azure Migrate doesn&rsquo;t just help you migrate your resources to the cloud, but also provides tools to modernize and optimize your infrastructure. The service helps you identify the right Azure services, configurations, and optimization strategies to ensure that your applications run efficiently and cost-effectively in the cloud.</p>
<h2 id="navigating-azure-migrate-versions">Navigating Azure Migrate Versions</h2>
<p>Azure Migrate comes in two versions: the current version and the previous (classic) version. The current version offers a more comprehensive set of features and capabilities, and should be the focus for new migration projects. If you have existing projects in the classic version, you can continue to use them, but the classic version will be retired in February 2024, so it&rsquo;s recommended to transition to the current version as soon as possible.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-azure-migrate">Getting Started with Azure Migrate</h2>
<p>To begin your Azure migration journey, explore the resources and tutorials available for assessing VMware VMs, Hyper-V VMs, and physical servers. Additionally, review the frequently asked questions to get a deeper understanding of the service. With Azure Migrate, you have a powerful and versatile platform to modernize your infrastructure and unlock the full potential of the cloud.</p>
