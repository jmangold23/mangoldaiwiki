<p>Microsoft Defender for Identity (MDI) is a powerful tool that plays a critical role in safeguarding your hybrid identity environment. As a component of the Microsoft 365 Defender suite, MDI gathers signals from on-premises Active Directory servers and uses these signals to protect your organization against hackers who attempt to leverage compromised accounts to move laterally across your on-premises workstations.</p>
<h2 id="how-mdi-works">How MDI Works</h2>
<p>MDI achieves this through the use of a sensor agent that you install on each domain controller. Over time, the sensor learns about your network and end-user behavioral patterns, allowing it to detect anomalies and alert you to any suspicious activity that requires investigation.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-mdi">Setting Up MDI</h2>
<p>To get started with MDI, you&rsquo;ll need to follow a few key steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Set up the Defender for Identity Instance</strong>: Begin by connecting to your Azure Domain Controller VM and signing in to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. From there, navigate to the Settings &gt; Identities section to initiate the creation of your Defender for Identity instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create the Directory Service Account</strong>: Defender for Identity requires a dedicated Directory Service account that the sensor can use to query the domain controller and track data for analysis. This account should be a regular user account without domain administrator privileges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configure the Directory Service Account</strong>: Once you&rsquo;ve created the account, return to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal and go to Settings &gt; Identities &gt; Directory Service Accounts. Add the credentials for the account you just created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Install the Sensor</strong>: In the Defender for Identity portal, go to the Sensors section and click the Add sensor button. This will provide you with an installer and an access key that you&rsquo;ll need to complete the sensor installation on your domain controller.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disable the Learning Period</strong>: By default, Defender for Identity requires a learning period of up to 30 days per domain controller to build a baseline of your network and end-user behavior. To speed up this process, you can disable the learning period in the Advanced settings section of the Defender for Identity portal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="generating-and-viewing-alerts">Generating and Viewing Alerts</h2>
<p>To test the capabilities of Defender for Identity, you can perform some simple attack simulations, such as using nslookup to attempt a DNS zone transfer. This will trigger an alert in the Defender for Identity portal, which you can then investigate further.</p>
<p>By navigating to the Device summary page and then the Timeline, you&rsquo;ll be able to see the event logged for the suspicious nslookup command, providing you with valuable insights into the activity that triggered the alert.</p>
<p>Overall, Microsoft Defender for Identity is a crucial tool for protecting your hybrid identity environment, helping you detect and respond to threats that target your on-premises infrastructure. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can quickly get up and running with MDI and start leveraging its powerful capabilities to keep your organization secure.</p>
