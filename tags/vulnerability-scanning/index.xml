      <description>Securing Container Images in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Container and container image security is a critical priority when developing and running applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Outdated base images or unpatched application runtimes can introduce security risks and potential attack vectors. To minimize these risks, you can integrate and run scanning and remediation tools within your containers during the build and runtime phases. The earlier you can identify and address vulnerabilities or outdated base images, the more secure your application will be.</description>

      <description>Containers and container image security are critical priorities when developing and running applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Outdated base images or unpatched application runtimes introduce security risks and potential attack vectors. To minimize these risks, you can integrate and run scanning and remediation tools in your containers during both the build and runtime stages. The earlier you identify vulnerabilities or outdated base images, the more secure your application will be.</description>
