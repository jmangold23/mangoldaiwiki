      <description>The integration runtime (IR) is the compute infrastructure that Azure Data Factory and Synapse pipelines use to provide data-integration capabilities across different network environments. A self-hosted integration runtime can run copy activities between a cloud data store and a data store in a private network, as well as dispatch transform activities against compute resources in an on-premises network or an Azure virtual network.
This comprehensive guide covers the key aspects of setting up and managing a self-hosted integration runtime:</description>

      <description>Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime is now generally available in Azure Synapse Analytics, allowing you to use it and the Execute SSIS Package activity in your Synapse pipelines. This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to create an Azure-SSIS integration runtime (IR) in Azure Data Factory (ADF) or Synapse Analytics via the Azure portal.
The Azure-SSIS IR supports running packages deployed into the SSIS catalog (SSISDB) hosted by Azure SQL Database server or Managed Instance (Project Deployment Model), as well as packages deployed into Azure Files (Package Deployment Model).</description>
