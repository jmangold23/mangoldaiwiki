      <description>Mastering Product Backlog Forecasting in Azure Boards Teams use the forecast tool in Azure Boards to help with their sprint planning efforts. By plugging in a value for the team velocity, the forecast tool shows which items in the backlog can be completed within future sprints. Both tools are team-specific and rely on the team&amp;rsquo;s ability to estimate backlog items. Once your team has completed a sprint or two, they can use the team velocity to forecast how much of the backlog they can finish within the upcoming sprints.</description>

      <description>In this comprehensive guide, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to set up Azure Machine Learning&amp;rsquo;s automated machine learning (AutoML) for time-series forecasting using the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK and CLI. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover everything from preparing your data to orchestrating the entire workflow, including training, inference, and model evaluation.
Prepare Your Data for Forecasting To start, your input data for AutoML forecasting must contain valid time series in tabular format. Each variable should have its own corresponding column in the data table.</description>

      <description>In this notebook, we&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate how to use Azure Machine Learning&amp;rsquo;s automated machine learning (AutoML) for time-series forecasting, specifically using deep learning models to forecast GitHub daily active users (DAU).
Prepare Data We&amp;rsquo;ll start by loading the GitHub daily active users data into an MLTable, which is the required format for AutoML forecasting jobs.
import pandas as pd from azure.ai.ml import Input from azure.ai.ml.constants import AssetTypes # Load the GitHub DAU data df = pd.</description>

      <title>Mastering Time-Series Forecasting with Azure Machine Learning&#39;s Automated ML</title>

      <description>In this comprehensive guide, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive deep into setting up Azure Machine Learning&amp;rsquo;s Automated ML for time-series forecasting. Unlike classical time series methods, Automated ML takes a unique approach by &amp;ldquo;pivoting&amp;rdquo; past time-series values to become additional dimensions for the regressor, along with other predictors. This approach allows Automated ML to incorporate multiple contextual variables and their relationships during training, making it a powerful tool for real-world forecasting scenarios.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start by preparing your data for time-series modeling, ensuring that all features used in training can be used when running predictions for your intended horizon.</description>
