      <description>Mastering Product Backlog Forecasting in Azure Boards Teams use the forecast tool in Azure Boards to help with their sprint planning efforts. By plugging in a value for the team velocity, the forecast tool shows which items in the backlog can be completed within future sprints. Both tools are team-specific and rely on the team&amp;rsquo;s ability to estimate backlog items. Once your team has completed a sprint or two, they can use the team velocity to forecast how much of the backlog they can finish within the upcoming sprints.</description>
