      <description>Azure Cloud Services is a widely used Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering that allows developers to focus on building applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.

One such evolution is the introduction of Azure Cloud Services (extended support), which provides several benefits over the classic deployment model.
